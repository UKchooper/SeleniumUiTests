I've created this repo to help anyone that wants to create Selenium UI automation tests for Window Applications. This repo is intended to be used as a good example of how to setup a test automation project.

The project uses:
1. Selenium
2. WinAppDriver
3. Specflow

I have tried to use as many best practices as possible, however, if I have missed some, could improve in areas etc let me know!

I have used the windows calculator as this should be pre-installed on all windows computers.
