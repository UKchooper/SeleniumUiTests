I've created this repo to help anyone that wants to create Selenium UI automation tests for Window Applications. This repo is intended to be used as a good example of how to setup a test automation project.

The project uses:
1. Selenium
2. WinAppDriver
3. Specflow

I have tried to use as many best practices as possible, however, if I have missed some, could improve in areas etc let me know!

Prerequisite:
- Windows calculator (should be pre-installed on all windows computers)
- Visual Studio 2022 with SpecFlow for Visual Studio 2022 extension
- WinAppDriver (https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppDriver/releases/tag/v1.2.99). Once downloaded and installed, run WinAppDriver.exe (default location: C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Application Driver)
- Locate/Install Inspect.exe

To do:
1. Showcase different Locators
2. Show different uses of xpath
